# CS255-System-analysis-and-design
The DriverPass project was focused on creating a system for a small business that helps students pass their driving tests by providing online classes, practice tests, and scheduling for on the road training. The client Liam, wanted a web based system that could handle everything from lesson reservations and payments to tracking student progress and DMV updates. The goal was to design a secure, flexible platform that sudents, instructors, and office staff could all use easily.

One thing I think I did particularly well was clearly defining the system components and how they connect to each other. I made sure my diagrams showed a logical flow between users and the system, which helped visualize how everything worked together. I also feel that my technical requirements section was strong because I included realistic details about the cloud setup, security, and scalability. Those details showed I understood what it would take for the system to actually function in the real world.

If I could go back and revise one part, I'd probably improve some of my UML diagrams. While they met requirements, I think I could have simplified the relationships between certain classes or even shown more specific interactions between the user and system in the sequence diagram. Making those cleaner and easier to follow would make my documentation look more professional and easier for others to understand.

When designing the system, I focused on what the users needed the most, convenience, flexibility, and security. I made sure the students could register, schedule lessons, and make payments all in one place, while instructors could log progress and the office staff could manage everything from the same system. Considering user needs is one of the most important parts of the system design because if the system doesnt fit how people actually work or think, it wouldnt be successful.

In the future, I plan to keep improving my approach by starting every project with strong user research and clear diagrams before jumping into development. I've learned how helpful it is to use UML tools early on to plan things out visually. I'll also keep focusing on modular design and security from the start. Overall, this project helped me understand how to balance user experience with technical structure somthing I'll carry with me as I move forward.
